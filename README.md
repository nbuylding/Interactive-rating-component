## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned how to create events that takes you from one page layout to another without having to add a separate html page to my code.


### Continued development

The biggest thing I need to work on is applying all the facets I've learned about JavaScript to my webpages. I understanding the syntax and how to use the different formulas, however I don't know how to apply them in a practical setting (i.e. creating events for this challenge).

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped to remind me how to use certain CSS tools, specifically the shorthands for padding and margins.
- [W3 School](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped to remind me of the value placement for the margin and padding shorthands.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This helped me to center a container without using flexbox by default.
- [YouTube Tutorials](https://youtube.com/) - This helped to guide me through the JavaScript portion of this challenge, pointing me in the right direction while also allowing me to adjust things to fit my code.
